    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Amazing, spicy red curry cauliflower wings that are baked not fried, gluten-free, and plant-based.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Batter</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup brown rice flour or chickpea flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp tandoori masala spice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>pinch of sea salt</li>
        <li>6-8 Tbsp water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup red curry paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>2-3 Tbsp water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cauliflower</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head cauliflower</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 F (232 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (important or the wings will stick).</li>
        <li>Next, prepare batter. Mix dry ingredients together, and then add almond milk and lesser amount of water to start (6 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Stir with a whisk or fork until well combined. You want the batter thick but pourable so it can adhere to the cauliflower – too runny and it won’t stick. Add only enough water until you reach the right consistency. Add more brown rice flour if it becomes too thin.</li>
        <li>Once the oven is preheated, add the cauliflower to the batter to coat. Shake off excess and place on baking sheet. Give each piece 1 inch of room to prevent sogginess. Depending on the size of your cauliflower this may require cooking on two baking sheets or in two batches (or more if increasing batch size).</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes. In the meantime prepare the sauce by whisking together curry paste, coconut oil, and maple syrup. Add just a bit of water to thin so it resembles a glaze consistency.</li>
        <li>Once the cauliflower has finished baking, remove from oven and dip/toss in the glaze 1-2 pieces at a time. Shake off excess, then place back on baking sheet and bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until browned on the edges and the glaze has caramelized.</li>
        <li>While baking, prepare chutney (optional), by adding all ingredients to a blender and blending until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more garlic for zing, salt for saltiness, maple syrup for sweetness, or water to thin.</li>
        <li>Let cauliflower cool slightly and then serve immediately. Best when fresh. The wings can be frozen (either at the glazed stage or the glazed and baked stage) and then reheated in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven until warmed through.</li>
    </ol>
