    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Stir Fry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>14 oz package extra-firm tofu</li>
        <li>2 cups roughly chopped green beans</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced red pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp sesame oil (for sauteing)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp maple syrup or agave</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and begin drying your tofu. Drain, remove it from the package and place between two thick towels folded into the shape of the tofu. Then place a plate or bowl on top and top it with something heavy like a book or skillet</li>
        <li>Let it dry for about 15 minutes, changing your towels if they get too wet. Once dry, unwrap, chop tofu into roughly 1-inch cubes or rectangles</li>
        <li>Arrange tofu on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet to prevent sticking and bake for a total of 25-35 minutes, flipping once halfway through to ensure even cooking. This will dry out the tofu and help give it a more meat-like texture. If you want a tougher texture, cook it for 30-35. For a slightly more tender texture, pull it out at 20-25 minutes to check.</li>
        <li>Once itâ€™s golden brown and a bit tough and firm, remove from the oven set it out to dry a bit more while you prep your vegetables.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together all of the sauce ingredients and set aside.</li>
        <li>To a large skillet over medium-high heat, add sesame oil and swirl to coat. Then add veggies and toss to coat. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring often. When the vegetables have some color and have softened a bit, add the sauce and stir. It should bubble and thicken. Then add the tofu and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Cook the mixture for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. When veggies are cooked to your preferred doneness, remove from heat. Serve as is or over rice for a more filling meal.</li>
    </ol>
